# TensorFlow.js Example: Addition RNN

This example uses an RNN to compute the addition of two integers by doing
string => string translation. Obviously it's not the best way to add two
numbers, but it makes a fun example.

Note: this example is a port of the Keras addition RNN example with a UI.

You can find the original Keras python code [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/nlp/addition_rnn.py).
